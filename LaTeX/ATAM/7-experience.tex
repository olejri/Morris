\section{Own experiences using ATAM}

The experience of discussing our own and our opponent group's architecture was good, and forced us to think critically about our architecture, while coming up with suggestions and risks associated with our opponent group's tactics. \\

We mainly used the short ATAM summary provided, and followed the steps in the process in our meeting. We feel that the steps are fine, but the detail level in the summary could be higher. \\

In addition to an increased level of insight in architectural problematics, we also gained an interest as stakeholders to our opponent group's project.
