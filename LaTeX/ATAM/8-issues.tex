\section{Problems and issues}

Our opponent group was unable to meet with us on Monday in the first evaluation phase, meaning that we were unable to take a deeper look into their documentation before Thursdayâ€™s meeting. \\

The rules for the conduct of the exercise was poorly specified, and the template differs a lot from the steps in the textbook. We feel that the assistants in the course should take responsibility for the distribution of the documentation. In addition, we expected that there would be some kind of facilitation of the first meeting of the groups. This was not the case, and we wasted our time showing up for this. \\

The ATAM-template is poorly detailed, and has caused a lot of confusion during this project phase.
