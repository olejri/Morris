\subsection{Game rules}
The game is implemented with the same set of rules as the classic board game \emph{Nine Men's Morris} \cite{morris}. The goal of the game is to either block any opponent moves, or to reduce your opponent's piece number to less than three. If you get three pieces in a row, you enter a morris state, and are allowed to remove one of your opponent's pieces. Pieces that are in a morris state, i.e. forms three in a row either horizontally or vertically, are not removable.

The first thing that meets the user after starting the application for the first time, is a Skiller dialogue asking the user to create a Skiller account. This account will later be used for playing the game online.
