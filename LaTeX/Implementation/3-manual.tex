\subsection{Game rules}

The game is implemented with the same set of rules as the classic board game \emph{Nine Men's Morris} \cite{morris}. The goal of the game is to either block any opponent moves, or to reduce your opponent's piece number to less than three. If you get three pieces in a row, you enter a morris state, and are allowed to remove one of your opponent's pieces. Pieces that are in a morris state, i.e. forms three in a row either horizontally or vertically, are not removable.
