\subsection{Game rules}

The game is implemented with the same set of rules as the classic board game \emph{Nine Men's Morris} \cite{morris}. The goal of the game is to either block any opponent moves, or to reduce your opponent's piece number to less than three. If you get three pieces in a row, you enter a morris state, and are allowed to remove one of your opponent's pieces. Pieces that are in a morris state, i.e. forms three in a row either horizontally or vertically, are not removable.

\subsubsection{Online mode}

If you start an online game as described in section \ref{section:game_mode}, you are taken to the board screen, and need to wait for another player to join your game. The guest, i.e. the one who joins the game, will get the initial move. Your own pieces will always be white.
