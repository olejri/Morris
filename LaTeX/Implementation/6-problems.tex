%In addition to listing problems and issues with the document or with the implementation process, this is also a spot to reflect upon the project and discuss what you would have done differently if you were to start again from scratch.

It turned out that the Skiller framework was poorly documented and it gave some unreadable exception messages. This slowed down the testing quite a bit. In addition, because we normally have only had two Android devices at our disposal, much of the testing have been done in the emulator. This is of course not very effective. Also, when running the application in the emulator and creating games, players would automatically join without user interaction. The Skiller team was unable to give us any good answers to why we experienced this problem.\\

We underestimated the importance of groupwide understanding of the framework, and the implementation should have been done collectively. As it was, we assigned one person to this task, and the rest of the group were unable to do anything with the framework in his absence. We also should  have a done a more thourogh research regarding the use of the framework and its documentation. \\

\subsection{Gained experieces}
In future projects we will spend 



Some members of the group went into this project with more experience than others, developing native Android applications. Due to good communication, we have been able to use this experience to our advantage.

The state pattern turned out working well, and we have gain
