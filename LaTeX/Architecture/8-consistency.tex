\section{Consistency among views}
The logical view shows a class diagram with tags indicating the different entity types. The classes that are within the same package in the development view,  are placed together. The entity types and class naming conforms with the diagram for the development view, and the process view uses the same class names as shown in the logical view. \\

The physical view is inconsistent with the other views, and is included to show that the application interacts with the server of the Skiller framework.
