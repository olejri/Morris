\section{Architectural tactics}

\subsection{Modifiability}                       

\subsubsection{Prevention of Ripple Effect}
The code should contain as few dependencies as possible in order to avoid ripple effect when making changes to the code.

\subsubsection{Localize Changes}
As our quality requirements highlight in the Requirements Document \cite{requirement}, we have anticipated several possible extensions to our game application. We have taken this into account, and will build our architecture with this in mind.

\subsection{Usability}

\subsubsection{User feedback between implementation iterations}
To optimize the usability of our user interface, we will get feedback from outside users during the project.

\subsubsection{Follow the Android user interface guidelines} 
These design principles were developed by and for the Android User Experience Team to keep users' best interests in mind. We will consider them as we apply your own creativity and design thinking.

\subsection{Testability}
\subsubsection{Testing third party multiplayer connection}
The application uses a third party multiplayer feature. This makes connection testing easy, as it is detached from the rest of the application.
