\section{Architectural patterns}

\subsection{States}
The state pattern will be implemented in order to ensure high modifiability, and to be able to smoothly change the state of the game at runtime. The different states of the game is shown in the logical view in section 7.1.

\subsection{MVC}
Model-View-Controller pattern will be used when implementing “Nine Men’s Morris”, where we will isolate the domain logic from the user interface.This will separate our program into distinct features, which will be easier to develop, test and maintain.

In Android the Activities will be our View-and-Controller, so as the View it will need need to implement the Observer interface. As the Controller, it will need to implement the OnClickListener interface. The Activity’s methods are going to access the Model.

\subsection{Singleton}
To avoid unnecessary instantiation of objects, we will implement the singleton pattern where we see fit. This will benefit the developer that only needs to deal with one instance of the object in question.
