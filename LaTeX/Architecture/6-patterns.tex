\subsection{Architectural patterns}

\subsubsection{MVC}
Model-View-Controller pattern will be used when implementing \emph{Nine Men’s Morris}, where we will isolate the domain logic from the user interface. This will separate our program into distinct features, which will be easier to develop, test, and maintain. \\
In Android the Activities will be our View-and-Controller, so as the \emph{View} it will need need to implement the \emph{Observer} interface. As the \emph{Controller}, it will need to implement the \emph{OnClickListener} interface. The Activity’s methods are going to access the \emph{Model}.

\subsection{Design pattern}
\subsubsection{States}
The state pattern will be implemented in order to ensure high modifiability, and to be able to smoothly change the state of the game at runtime. The different states of the game is shown in the logical view in section 7.1.

\subsubsection{Singleton}
To avoid unnecessary instantiation of objects, we will implement the singleton pattern where we see fit. This will benefit the developer that only needs to deal with one instance of the object in question.
