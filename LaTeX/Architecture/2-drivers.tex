\section{Architectural drivers}
Project selection was based on being able to use the architectures that were used in the course. This is to maximize the learning outcomes and make the project feasible. We also want to create an architecture that can be developed without any big problems. The different architectural drivers, that has shaped the project is listed under in sub-sections.

\subsection{Functional requirements}
Functional requirements is a big architectural driver because the architecture must adapt to the functional requirements to ensure desired functionality.
 
%Quality in all parts of the architecture
\subsection{Quality attributes requirements}
Having modifiability as our main quality attribute will be a huge architectural driver and will be kept in mind when build the architecture to ensure changeable and modular code.

\subsection{Technical constraints}
The technical constraints is an architectural driver because the architecture must adapt to the Android platform.

\subsection{Business constraints}
The project lifetime is only 10 weeks. We must limit the functionality and possibilities of the project to keep it a realistic project.

\subsection{Fast start up}
The faster we get the architecture done, the faster we can start programming. We will try to be one week a head of the plan. This will make our schedule resistant for problems that might arise.
