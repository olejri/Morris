\section{Architectural drivers}

Project Selection was based on being able to use the architectures that were used in the course. This is to maximize the learning outcomes and make the project feasible. We also want to create an architecture that can be developed without any big problems. On these criteria the needed business qualities are listed in the following sub-sections.

\subsubsection{Functional requirements}
Functional requirements is a big architectural driver because the architecture must adapt to the functional requirements to ensure desired functionality.
 
%Quality in all parts of the architecture
\subsection{Quality attributes requirements}
To create a good architecture we want to make sure all parts of the documentation is well thought through, and that all parts are connected and understandable for all group members.

\subsection{Technical constraints}
The technical constraints 

\subsection{Business constraints}
The project lifetime is only 10 weeks. We must limit the functionality and possibilities of the project so that it becomes feasible.

\subsection{Fast start up}
The faster we get the architecture done, the faster we can start programming. We will try to be one week a head of the plan. This will make our schedule resistant for problems that might arise.
