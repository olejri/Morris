\section{Functional requirements}

Functional requirements capture the intended behavior of the system, this behavior is expressed in the form of functions the system is expected to perform. Priorities on each requirement is set to plan for staged deliveries and make the necessary trade-off decisions. The priorities is described in the following table.

\begin{table}[h!]
\begin{tabular}{ | p{90pt} | p{270pt}  |}
\hline
\bf Names &  \bf Meanings  \\ \hline
High & The product is not acceptable unless these requirements are satisfied \\ \hline 
Medium & Would enhance the product, but the product is not unacceptable if absent  \\ \hline
Low & Functions that may or may not be worthwhile \\ \hline
