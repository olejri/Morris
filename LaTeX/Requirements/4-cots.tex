\section{COTS Components and Technical Constraints}
Android \cite{Android} is a Linux based operation system developed by Open Handset Alliance. It runs on smart phones, computer tablets and mobile devices. Android is open source which makes it a friendly developer's platform. Developers write in a customized version of Java (Android library).

% In addition to Android, our project involves Open Feint, which is a multi-player game framework.??? [x]

\subsection{Touch screen}
Android smart phones all have touch screen, therefore its very important that the game must be designed in a way that it interacts well with the screen constraints. Both the physical buttons and the touch menu must be designed in a way so that the user understand what they press.

\subsection{Scree resolution}
Android smart phones have different screen resolution, in this project we will test the application with a Samsung Galaxy SII and HTC Desire. Both phones use the same resolution but the the Galaxy SII has a much bigger screen, the limited resolutions and screen size will require a precise and well designed layout.

\subsection{Android device game only}
The game will only be able to run successfully on Android smart phones.
