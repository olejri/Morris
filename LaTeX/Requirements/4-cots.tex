\section{COTS Components and Technical Constraints}
Android \cite{Android} is a Linux based operation system developed by Open Handset Alliance. It runs on smart phones, computer tablets and mobile devices. Android is open source, and developers writes in a customized version of Java\cite{sdk}. In addition to original Android, our project involves the usage of Skiller\cite{Skiller}, which is a platform help develop networking multiplayer games. Skiller provides multiple tools to implement social and game-additive features, such as achivements and in-game items and much more.

% In addition to Android, our project involves Open Feint, which is a multi-player game framework.??? [x]
\subsection{Activities -- Android software?}
An android application consists of activities, an activity is normally associated with a view. This view holds a canvas that the draw method can draw upon. We need to keep this in mind when developing our project.

\subsection{Touch screen}
Android smart phones all have touch screens, therefore its very important that the game must be designed in a way that it interacts well with the screen constraints. Both the physical buttons and the touch menus must be designed in a way so that the user understand what they press.

\subsection{Screen resolution}
Android smart phones have different screen resolution, in this project we will test the application with a Samsung Galaxy SII and HTC Desire. Both phones use the same resolution but the the Galaxy SII has a much bigger screen, the limited resolutions and screen size will require a precise and well designed layout.

\subsection{Android device game only}
The game will only be able to run successfully on Android smart phones.
