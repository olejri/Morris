\section{Issues}

%In section \ref{section:quality_mod} we have listed quality requirements for our primary focus; modifiability. It seems that we have misunderstood this part, as the quality requirements we set up actually are future extensions that we have taken into account when planning our architecture. We have chosen to leave them as they are, to examplify our vision for these extensions.

\subsection{Skiller framework}
We encountered some limitations with the Skiller framework, one that has affected our requirements has been the \emph{"Random start"}. Where Skiller does not make it worthwhile to implement it, thus we have removed the requirement entirely.
