\subsection{Reasons}
Added an overall description of the functional requirements, and each priority is now fully described in a table. The functional requirement “FR6 - Random start” has been removed, this is partly because of the limitation of our 3rd party network tool and partly the little significance on the game experience. The functional requirement “FR8 - Sound effects” has been removed as a functional requirement and added as a quality requirement. Removed duplicate requirement “FR10 - Highlighting possible moves”, as this is also a quality requirement. Added functional requirement “FR8 - Denied Morris state” to fulfil the Nine Men’s Morris game rules. All priorities are reviewed with the new prioritization scale. The quality requirement to implement AI has been replaced due to the time available in this course, with a lighter operation.
